# SDM_CDM
DDL Generator and DDL for Semantic Data Modeling v.1.08
=================

The tool generates DDL files for SDM DWH. SDM is an abbreviation of “Semantic Data Model”, designed for standardization of DWH to share cohort query and BI tools experiences in the healthcare community. See details about SDM at the SDM consortium (http://sdm-c.org/).

If you want to get the full Common Data Model(CDM) specification of SDM, please consider subscribing the specification from the SDM consortium.

Currently, it is confirmed that the script generates DDL for SQLite3, MySQL, PostgreSQL, DB2, Oracle, Microsoft SQL. The DDL of RDBMS supported by sqlalchemy library and plugin may be generated by customizing the supported_rdbms list. [Don’t forget to install sqlalchemy and related DB modules]

If you simply want to build SDM-based DWH, you need not run the tool, however, you may copy DDL file suitable for your specific environment from the 'sql' directory.

Installation
==================

pip install numpy pandas
pip install sqlalchemy #requires SQLAlchemy 1.2 or later	
pip install ibm_db_sa #(optional) for who wants DB2 support.

Place the SDM schema definition file on the specified folder(../specs) of the script and run with:

python export.py

It will generate DDL files of SDM DWH in 'sql' folder for RDBMS implements supported by sqlalchemy.
AS the SDM schema definition file is the copyrighted works of SDM consortium, it is not distributed with this source code and DDLS.
